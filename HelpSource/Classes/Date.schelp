class:: Date
summary:: an object describing a point in time
categories:: Control


ClassMethods::

method::new
Create a new date with the given properties (all numerical values). These arguments are also the names of instance variables of the date object. The minimum required to specify is the year, month and day (hour/minute/second are optional and default to 0). If the teletype::dayOfWeek:: or teletype::rawSeconds:: are not given explicitly (normally, they shouldn't be), they will be computed from the other values.

It is possible to specify dates with "out of range" values that will be resolved into a valid range -- this allows simple date offset calculations to be performed (see example below).

code::
(
var a = Date(2017, 10, 25);
[a.asString, a.dayOfWeek, a.rawSeconds].postln; // dayOfWeek and rawSeconds were computed

("Party like it's" + Date(1999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)).postln;

// Simple date/time offsetting can be performed:
("One hundred days before Christmas:" + Date(2010, 12, 25 - 100).format("%B %d")).postln;

// Nnvalid dates are "corrected"
Date(2017, 2, 29).postln; // March 1: 2017 was not a leap year!
)
::

method::newFromFormattedString
Create a new Date object from a date/time string, which is parsed according to the provided format string.

code::
Date.newFromFormattedString("2017-10-25 13:25:55", "%F %T");
Date.newFromFormattedString("1981.9.30 @ 5:33pm", "%Y.%m.%d @ %I:%M%p");

(
// It would be nicer if "stamp" used four digits for the year,
// because the parsing code only works for two-digit years when
// there is a separator (even when using two-digit %y or %C formats).
// So here, we prepend "20" before the stamp string...
var stampString = Date(2013, 5, 25, 10, 9, 8).stamp.post;
" --> ".post;
Date.newFromFormattedString("20" ++ stampString, "%y%m%d_%H%M%S").postln;
)
::

argument:: string
The date/time string to parse, for example teletype::"2017-10-25 13:25:55"::.

argument:: format
The format to use to parse the date string.  The '%' codes are the same as those used in link::#-format::.  For example, to parse the above string, you would use teletype::"%F %T"::.


method::getDate
Get current date from system and create a date object from it.
code::
(
var a = Date.getDate;
a.rawSeconds.postln;
a.dayOfWeek.postln;
a
)
::

method::localtime
Get current localized time from system and create a date object from it.

method::gmtime
Get current strong::Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):: from system and create a date object from it.

method::seed
Get current date and return a value suitable for seeding a random number generator. See also link::Reference/randomSeed##randomSeed::.
code::
(
var a = Date.seed;
thisThread.randSeed = a;
20.do { [1,0].choose.post }; "".postln;
thisThread.randSeed = a;
25.do { [1,0].choose.post }; "".postln;
)
::

InstanceMethods::

method::localtime
Set the receiver's time to current localtime.

method::gmtime
Set the receiver's time to current strong::Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)::.

method::dayStamp
Obtain a string with the year, month and day in the format strong::YYMMDD::.

method::hourStamp
Obtain a string in the format strong::H:M:S::.

method::secStamp
Obtain a string with the seconds.

method::stamp
Obtain a string in the format strong::YYMMDD_HHMMSS::.

method::asSortableString
Obtain a string in an alphabetically sortable standard database format.

method::asctime
Obtain a string in the format WeekdayName MonthName Time Year.

method::asString
Returns asctime.

method::format
Obtain a date string with a given format. The character % is replaced by the appropriate value, which is derived from the letter that follows.
code::
Date.getDate.format("Today is %A. It is around %I o'clock (%p), in %B.");
Date.getDate.format("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M");  // DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm
