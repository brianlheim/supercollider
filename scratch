missing from SC_WorldOptions.h

    bool dump_version;
    uint16_t threads;
    uint32_t udp_port, tcp_port;
    uint16_t use_system_clock;

remaining usage:
    set_realtime_priority
    needs blocksize & sample rate (ns per block) on apple

    set_realtime_priority is in thread_init_functor::operator()
    server uses it in scheduler<thread_init_functor>

    set_realtime_priority is in realtime_engine_functor::init_thread() (static!!)
    realtime_engine_functor is used as templ param to audio_backend's
    this is fine, just add a new arg to init_thread and fill in w appropriate value from args
    may need new args to open_stream/open_client

    should the new arg go in ctor or op() for thread_init_functor

    is this a problem for intialization order? when is SR mutated?

    jack_thread_init_callback is static but requires nsPerBlock...
